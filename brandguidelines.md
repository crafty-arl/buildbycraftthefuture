## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn by doing. Always interactive.
- Run code in the browser. No setup.
- Track progress locally or through light auth.
- Respect your time: small lessons, real outcomes.
- Scale naturally into projects.

## ✅ Success Looks Like...

- A user goes from "never coded" → "building simple tools"
- People return to `/build` when they want to figure something out fast
- Instructors, students, and self-taught devs all use `/build` as a foundation
- Every module leads to **something you built**, not just something you read
